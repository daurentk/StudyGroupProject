Q: Tell us about your previous Scrum team:
A: "We had a team of 10 people in our scrum team:
 Product Owner Elena,
Scrum Master - Oleksandr.
Me and another SDET, Iulia, were in charge of QA for all the work done

Q: How was your product owner?
A: "Ooh, she was very strict and demanding, showing up every day until she started dating that Iranian singer..."
